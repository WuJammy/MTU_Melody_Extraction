# MTU: A Novel Melody Extraction Method Using Swin U-Net Enhanced with Mamba Blocks
## Abstract
MTU is a novel melody extraction method tailored
for polyphonic audio, addressing both vocal and non-vocal music
tracks. Its architecture integrates Swin U-Net with Mamba
blocks, enhancing feature extraction and achieving multi-scale
representation of intricate polyphonic music signals. A key
innovation of MTU is the adoption of multiple patch sequences
with varied orders within Mamba blocks, significantly improving melody extraction accuracy. 
Furthermore, a preprocessing technique involving a Gaussian filter smooths the target salience map,refining melody labeling on the spectrum and boosting training effectiveness. 
Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets,including ADC2004, MIREX05, and MedleyDB, demonstrate
MTUâ€™s exceptional performance across crucial metrics such as
pitch and chroma accuracy, positioning it as a leading solution
for melody extraction in complex polyphonic scenarios.


## Environment SetUp
- Python Version: 3.8.10  
  You can use Miniconda to setup Python environment.  
  Reference : https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/.
- PyTorch Version: 1.13.1  
  CUDA Version 11.6
  ```
  pip install torch==1.13.1+cu116 torchvision==0.14.1+cu116 torchaudio==0.13.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
  ```
  CUDA Version 11.7
  ```
  pip install torch==1.13.1+cu117 torchvision==0.14.1+cu117 torchaudio==0.13.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
  ```
- Download MeldeyDB Package
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/marl/medleydb.git
  cd medleydb
  pip install .
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  Set MEDLEYDB_PATH to the local directory of MedleyDB
  ```
  export MEDLEYDB_PATH="MedleyDB Dataset Path"
  ```
  To make it permanent, add the above line ```~/.bashrc```.  
  Note : You may find ```yaml.load()``` errors while running the program. This is due to outdated syntax in the MedleyDB source code. Simply replace ```yaml.load(file)``` with ```yaml.load(file, Loader=yaml.FullLoader)```.
